# Ironhack Einhorn Bot

This is a small discord bot, written as a fun project by the Amsterdam Ironhack webdev group July-September 2019

## Developing

1. Fork/Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install` in the directory of the bot
3. Add a `.env` file with a `TOKEN` parameter
4. Get the token from me ;)
5. Run the bot with either `nodemon` for instant reload on code changes or `npm run start`

We are using [Discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) as a framework. Documentation can be found on their GitHub and website.
